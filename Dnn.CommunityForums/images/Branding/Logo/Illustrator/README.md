#DNN Community Forums Logo Illustrator Files

Most files use [Icon.ai](Icon.ai) as a linked file, but that did not work for the SVG export.  
So the [Icon-OUTLINES.ai](Icon-OUTLINES.ai) file is "hand crafted" specifically for vector export as Illustrator did not export the rotated paths correctly to SVG.
