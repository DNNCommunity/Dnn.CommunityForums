        <h3>New <strong>&quot;Legacy Token&quot; Replacement</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Tokens are used in various templates to insert content from a forum, topic, reply, etc.
            into a page.
            However, in previous versions, HTML was injected from code for certain tokens, which
            made it impossible for a designer to tailor the HTML markup without customizing the
            code.
            DNN Community Forums 08.02.00 introduces new token replacement features that inject only
            the data associated with the token, allowing the designer to create whatever HTML markup
            is desired.
            The community-default and community-bootstrap themes and templates have been updated to
            include the markup that used to be generated in the module's code.
            However, for installed sites that have other themes and templates, DNN Community Forums
            08.02.00 will replace a legacy token--on-the-fly--with its modern replacement, including
            the previously-injected markup.
            <br />
            <br />
            For example, [GROUPNAME] will now be replaced by [FORUMGROUP:FORUMGROUPLINK|&lt;a
            href="{0}" class="dcf-forumgroup-link"&gt;[FORUMGROUP:GROUPNAME]&lt;/a&gt;]
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>
                IMPORTANT! The legacy token replacement feature will be supported through version
                10.00.00, and will then be removed.
            </b>
            <br /><br />
            If you use your own themes and templates, please visit <a href="https://github.com/DNNCommunity/Dnn.CommunityForums/wiki"

            read more and see which legacy tokens are replaced by which updated tokens.

        <h3>Removed <strong>Duplicated Templates</strong></h3>
        <p>
            In 08.00.00, template loading was enhanced to fallback/default from theme templates to
            module default templates, making it no longer necessary to duplicate all templates into
            a theme folder if not specifically customizing a template for a particular theme.
            Several templates shipped with the community themes have been removed in 08.02.00 since
            they
            are the same as the defaults in /config/templates. If you have a custom theme and a
            template has not been customized from the version shipped with DNN Community Forums,
            the template can be removed from your custom theme if desired.
