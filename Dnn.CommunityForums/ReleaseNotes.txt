        <h2 class="muy-importante">IMPORTANT: Upgrade 8.2 Notes</h2>
        <p>
            The release notes will follow, below these <b>important</b> notes.
        </p>

        <h3>New <strong>&quot;Legacy Token&quot; Replacement</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Tokens are used in various templates to insert content from a forum, topic, reply, etc.
            into a page.
            However, in previous versions, HTML was injected from code for certain tokens, which
            made it impossible for a designer to tailor the HTML markup without customizing the
            code.
            DNN Community Forums 08.02.00 introduces new token replacement features that inject only
            the data associated with the token, allowing the designer to create whatever HTML markup
            is desired.
            The community-default and community-bootstrap themes and templates have been updated to
            include the markup that used to be generated in the module's code.
            However, for installed sites that have other themes and templates, DNN Community Forums
            08.02.00 will replace a legacy token--on-the-fly--with its modern replacement, including
            the previously-injected markup.
            <br />
            <br />
            For example, [GROUPNAME] will now be replaced by [FORUMGROUP:FORUMGROUPLINK|&lt;a
            href="{0}" class="dcf-forumgroup-link"&gt;[FORUMGROUP:GROUPNAME]&lt;/a&gt;]
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>
                IMPORTANT! The legacy token replacement feature will be supported through version
                10.00.00, and will then be removed.
            </b>
            <br /><br />
            If you use your own themes and templates, please visit <a href="https://github.com/DNNCommunity/Dnn.CommunityForums/wiki"
                                                                        target="_blank">our wiki</a> to
            read more and see which legacy tokens are replaced by which updated tokens.

        </p>


        <h3>Removed <strong>Duplicated Templates</strong></h3>
        <p>
            In 08.00.00, template loading was enhanced to fallback/default from theme templates to
            module default templates, making it no longer necessary to duplicate all templates into
            a theme folder if not specifically customizing a template for a particular theme.
            Several templates shipped with the community themes have been removed in 08.02.00 since
            they
            are same as the defaults in /config/templates. If you have a custom theme, and a
            template has not been customized from the version shipped with DNN Community Forums,
            the template can be removed from your custom theme if desired.

            </p>

            <h3>New <strong>Bootstrap</strong> 4 &amp; 5 Forum Theme</h3>
            <p>
                Please be sure to test this and <a href="https://github.com/DNNCommunity/Dnn.CommunityForums/issues/new/choose"
                                                    target="_blank">report any issues you may find</a>. It's a brand-new
                feature!
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use the &quot;community-default&quot; or the
                &quot;community-bootstrap&quot; Theme, make sure to set the Avatar size to 250 x
                250 pixels in the Module Settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, please note that this version of the community-bootstrap theme will not
                work with Bootstrap 3 and/or the DNN Xcillion theme.
            </p>

            <h3>New <strong>Languages</strong> Added!</h3>
            <p>
                Dutch already had a language pack, but now there are language packs for German,
                French, Spanish, and Italian. They were generated though, so we could use your
                help from the community to make sure the translations are indeed accurate.
            </p>
            <p>
                We recommend that you use Peter Donker's translation software (below) to make
                things easier for you.

            <h3>Upgrading? <strong>Reindex</strong> Your Search</h3>
            <p>
                There have been significant updates in the way the forums module integrates with
                the DNN search engine. This includes a handful of bug fixes. It's important to
                reindex your DNN search as soon as possible after the upgrade.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>NEW</strong> CSS Loading Order</h3>
            <p>
                CSS loading has been improved to deliver robust CSS both within the module,
                across all themes, and then theme-specific with a custom override.
            </p>
            <p>
                New Community Forum's CSS Load order:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <pre>~/DesktopModules/ActiveForums/module.css</pre> (<em>
                        already
                        existing
                    </em>)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <pre>~/DesktopModules/ActiveForums/themes/themes.css</pre> (<em>
                        new name
                        and CSS content / used across all themes
                    </em>)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <pre>~/DesktopModules/ActiveForums/themes/_currenttheme_/theme{.min}.css</pre>
                    (<em>already existing / new name</em>). Can now have a .min.css variant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <pre>~/DesktopModules/ActiveForums/themes/_currenttheme_/custom/theme{.min}.css</pre>
                    (new) has been updated. Can now have a .min.css variant.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Orphaned Web.Config Update</h3>
            <p>
                If you have previously installed the Community Forums module --and its URL
                rewriter in order to use friendly URLs-- that process inserted
                the attribute <em>runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="true"</em> into the
                <em>&lt;configuration&gt;&lt;system.webServer&gt;&lt;modules&gt;</em>
                tag in the main <em>web.config</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Per <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.webserver/modules/"
                        target="_blank">
                    Microsoft
                    documentation
                </a>, this attribute is obsolete if you are running IIS 7
                (plus a patch), or IIS 8+.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since you <em>may</em> have other modules
                that require it, we have chosen to <strong>NOT</strong> remove it automatically.
                If you have no other modules that require it, you many
                remove it manually.
            </p>
