Forums Module for DNN Platform  

## What is the Community Forums Module?  

The Community Forums Module installs an online discussion forum that is tightly integrated with the DNN CMS platform. Previously offered as a commercial module from Active Modules, Inc., the codebase has been converted to an open-source project after the acquisition of Active Modules by DNN Corp.  

## Requirements  

* DNN Platform v9.4 and newer (aka DotNetNuke)  

## Getting Started  

* Download and install [the latest release](https://github.com/DNNCommunity/Dnn.CommunityForums/releases/latest) of the module install package.  
* Login as a superuser and install the module via the Extensions view in the persona bar.  
* Add an instance of the module to a page in your site.  

Module settings can be accessed by placing the page in edit mode and then clicking on the 'settings' button in the modules edit menu. Community Forum settings will appear in their own tab.  

When first added to a page, the forum module will create a set of sample forums.  Forum can be added, removed or changed using the "Control Panel" link visible to administrators.
