# Community Forums Module  

This is the official forums module for the [DNN CMS](https://dnncommunity.org/About-DNN) Community.  You'll find it in use on the [Official DNN Website](https://dnncommunity.org/Forums).  The forums module has been built and continues to be maintained with the goal of providing the many contemporary tools a forum-based community might need.  

This module was originally released as a commercial module many years ago, known as Active Forums.  Years after, the Active Modules company was acquired by DNN Corp, and much of the Intellectual Property (IP) was integrated into the DNN Platform and Evoq solutions.  However, extensions like this one were donated to the community as an open-source extension.  

The Community Forums module plans to help you and your fellow community members to have a productive, safe, and fun time communicating on your respective community website based on DNN.
